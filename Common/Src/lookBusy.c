   FUNCTION: lookBusyIterationRate()
   DESCRIPTION: This function returns lookBusy's iteration-rate:
   * The iterations are for lookBusy()'s for-loop.
   * The iteration-rate is measured as: iterations per 1 ms.
   DEPENDENCIES:
   * The SysTick timer is used.
     * It must be configured with a period of 1 ms, e.g., by HAL_Init.
     * Also, the timer must run on processor-clock frequency, which is the default.
   * HAL_Delay() is called, so HAL_Init() should be called before this function.
   * Interrupts are temporarily disabled, including the SysTick interrupt.

  // * (In these comments, units are shown in brackets, e.g., [iterations/ms] )
  // * The number of clock-cycles in 1 ms is determined, i.e., R [clock_cycles/ms]
  // * lookBusy() is then run for X iterations.
  // * The number of clock-cycles it took for the X iterations is measured, i.e., N [clock_cycles]
  // * The number of clock-cycles per iteration is calculated as: N/X [clock_cycles/iteration]
  // * The iteration-rate is calculated as:  R / (N/X) [iterations/ms]
  // * For calls to lookBusy(), processing done in addition to the for-loop is considered negligible.

  // The SysTick timer counts down from the value in SysTick->LOAD

  // * The SysTick exception request is activated when counting from 1 to 0.
  // * For the timer-period of 1 ms, there are (SysTick->LOAD + 1) clock cycles

  // * 500 us is used to be safe, to ensure lookBusy() runs less than 1 ms.

  // Specify an estimate for the number of clock-cycles per iteration of lookBusy()
  // * There are about 20 assembly instructions per iteration.
  // * The SysTick timer's clock frequency is the same as the processor's clock frequency.
  // * The clock-cycles per assembly instruction are not specified for Cortext M7 processors,
  //   but 5 is a reasonable over-estimate.
  // * So, 100 clock-cycles per iteration would be a reasonable estimate (20 * 5)
  // * From testing the present function, the actual number was found to be around 33 clock-cycles per iteration.
