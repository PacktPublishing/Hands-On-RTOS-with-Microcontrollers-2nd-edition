	Function: delay_us(microSeconds)

	Title: Delay, for the specified number of micro-seconds

	Description: The function spins for the specified number of micro-seconds

	Parameter:
	* microSeconds : specifies the delay, in micro-seconds
	* Permissible values:
	 * 0 <= microSeconds <= (999-val_read_period)
	 * val_read_period is the maximum period for the reads of SysTick->VAL, in the while-loop
	   * It's the time between executions of this instruction:  counterCurrentValue = (uint32_t) SysTick->VAL;
	 * val_read_period specifies micro-seconds, rounded up to the nearest integer

	MCU requirements:
	* ARMv7-M core, or similar core with:
	 * A SysTick timer and registers, as specified in:
		 * Reference: "Arm Cortex-M7 Devices Generic User Guide"
	 * Reads to the SysTick->VAL register must be an atomic operation
		 * Reference: "ARMv7-M Architecture Reference Manual"
	* SysTick timer configured for 1 ms period, e.g., configured by HAL_Init()

	Delay errors:
	* The actual delay is slightly longer than the input micro-seconds
		* Some causes for extra delay include:
		 * The execution time prior to the spin loop
		 * The execution time from when counterCurrentValue is last read, until when the function exits
		 * The period for the reads of SysTick->VAL, in the while-loop
	* The actual delay can also be longer if ISRs run concurrently with this function, near the end of
	  the delay.

	* This function was tested with an oscilloscope:
	 *  STM MCU STM32F767ZI
	 *  SysTick clock: 16 MHz
	 *  SYS->LOAD: 15999
	 *  Parameter values tested: 100, 500, and 900 micro-seconds
	 *  The actual delays were approximately 5 to 15 micro-seconds longer than the
			parameter value.

	Return value: None
